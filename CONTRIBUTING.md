# Contributing to Mikros

We love your input! We want to make contributing to Mikros as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

### Pull Requests

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`.
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests.
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes.
5. Make sure your code follows the existing style.
6. Issue that pull request!

### Code Style

- For Go code, follow the [Go Code Review Comments](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments)
- Run `gofmt` over your code before submitting.
- For documentation, follow a consistent Markdown style.

## Issues

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue; it's that easy!

### Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can.
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)
